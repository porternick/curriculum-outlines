#NOTES ABOUT TEACHING ASTRONOMY

First of all, do what you want! If you have experience teaching Astronomy, or an interest in a particular aspect of Astronomy, by all means teach what you know and want to teach.

Second, in lieu of a day-by-day plan, I've gathered an abundance of resources that you can choose to use from. The resources are located under the TV in my classroom. Below I have outlined a progression that I might use if I was teaching this unit. There is no set amount of material that I am expecting you to teach. Don't worry about "keeping pace" or not making it "through" the curriculum. With that said, I have found that a class which is busy with work has less time for shenanigans to occur. While good teaching can not solve all behavior problems, it can avoid some of them.

Lastly, I've made some copies for you already and they should be next to the books on the desk under the television. These are stand-alone(ish) activities/worksheets that you could use if you did not have much time to prepare.

#PROPOSED OUTLINE FOR TEACHING ASTRONOMY

It makes sense to me to start with the Earth and then work your way out when teaching Astronomy. Don't shy away from the textbook; the chapters on Astronomy are fairly well written. 

Here is a link to a YouTube playlist I curate which will be useful when teaching the subjects below: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjvgBS9Ay_esvfwv4mwG9-uTATs7AhsbO

##Big Idea: Exploration
##Essential Question: What value is there in exploration?

1.  Seasons: I've found that studying the cause of the seasons is an excellent transition from studying weather and climate to studying astronomy. The book "The Real Reasons for Seasons" is an excellent resource which includes background information for the teacher, and many valuable classroom activities. It also includes a pre- and post-survey to help students evaluate how their understandings change. Here is a little video that demonstrates how little Americans know about the causes of the seasons: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0wk4qG2mIg . If you show this to the students, I would stop the video before they begin to explain the real cause of the seasons.

**NOTE: Students LOVE learning about Astronomy. Of all the subjects you could teach as a science substitute, I think this is the best one.**
