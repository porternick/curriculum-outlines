1.  Read Chapter 17, Section 1
  1.  Latitude and Climate: use www.forecast.io/atlas to show tropics, temperate zones and polar zones
  2.  Large Bodies of Water: Google image search “lake superior lake effect snow”
  3.  Ocean Currents: Google image search "ocean currents." I like to explain how ocean currents keep San Diego a constant temp.
  4.  Mountains: Use Google Earth to show how the Sandia Mountains, because of their altitude, have a different climate.
  5.  Rain Shadows: Use Google Earth to show the rain shadow effect in the pacific northwest.
  6.  Cities: Use Google Earth to compare the size of large city like Los Angeles to a small city like Albuquerque.
2.  Watch a few videos that further explain what Climate is:

  5.  Have students set up lined sheet of paper to take notes about the three techniques while watching the following videos.
    1.  ON DVD: Unstoppable Solar Cycles [This is propaganda from The Heartland Insitute]
        1. FYI: http://www.desmogblog.com/heartland-institute-tricked-video-subject-in-unstoppable-solar-cycles

    2.  ON DVD: An Inconvenient Truth
  7.  After watching both videos on the DVD, I ask the students to reveiw their notes. I then ask them if both videos use pathos, ethos and logos (yes) AND what the difference is between the two videos.
